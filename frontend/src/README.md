# Frontend Source Directory

This directory contains the React/TypeScript source files for the dashboard.

## Structure

```
src/
├── components/          # React components organized by feature
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks (use*.ts)
├── utils/              # Utility functions by category
├── types/              # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── api/                # API client and endpoint definitions
```

## Guidelines

- Follow the component template in `frontend/.cursorrules`
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer named imports
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic to custom hooks
